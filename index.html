                    On my Portfolio website. I am currently a 18 year old highschool student with lots of different interests, mostly on the spectrum of 
                    computer science topics, such as webdevelopment or gamedevelopment. This page was created as a way to be able to show my projects, accomplishments and Skills
                    to people who might want to consider hiring me. The entire portfolio only spans this page and was fully created and designed by me, in HTML and CSS
